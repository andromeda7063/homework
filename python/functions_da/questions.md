    Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with distinct elements from the first list.
    Sample List : [1,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]
    Unique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 

     
    Write a Python function to check whether a number is "Perfect" or not.
    According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself).
    Example : The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128. 

     
    Write a Python program using function that accepts a hyphen-separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
    Sample Items : green-red-yellow-black-white
    Expected Result : black-green-red-white-yellow 

     
    Write a Python program that simulates a banking system. Create a function bank_account which takes a starting balance as input. Inside bank_account, define another function transaction that can either deposit or withdraw money from the account. The transaction function should accept two arguments: the operation ("deposit" or "withdraw") and the amount. The bank_account function should return the result of each transaction (updated balance).
